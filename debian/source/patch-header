Subject: Collected Debian patches for bluez    
Author: Robert Hedges <rhedges@truefitness.com>
The <package> package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining  
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem to
be worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this single
Debian patch.   

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git    
repository.
