To build bluez

clone the repository,  it contains three branches

pristine-tar (with the xxx.orig.tar.gz) information
upstream ( with the source code and no debian files)
master (source code and debian packaging files)

Current workflow would be to create a feature branch from upstream make the changes and then merge into a patch-queue to create the debian (quilt) patches. This will then be imported into master for packaging.






Commit should be done in git as usual.

Package building

Merge changes from the feature branch into master and commit them.

Snapshot release
to make a snapshot (testing) release:
update the debian changelog by running
git-dch --snapshot
               (If it complains about not finding a previous version, look at the git logs and see what was the latest commit prior to the changes in the snapshot and run)

git-dch --snapshot --since <treeish>
git add debian/changelog
git commit -m "build"
Build the package

git-buildpackage --git-pristine-tar -uc -us

Full Release

update the debian changelog by running
git-dch --release
               (If it complains about not finding a previous version, look at the git logs and see what was the latest commit prior to the changes in the snapshot and run)

git-dch --snapshot --since <treeish>

It will do the build in ../build-dir which will help keep the git tree clean.
